## ⚠️ An Important Note on Calculations

**The calculations in this app provide a powerful baseline based on a 'perfect' shot under the given conditions. However, every player has a unique swing and playstyle. The real power of the PRO version lies in its deep customization. We encourage you to use the "Customize Factors" menu to meticulously fine-tune the app's logic to perfectly match your personal in-game results. Think of this not as a 'perfect shot' button, but as a framework for you to build your own perfect strategy.**

## Direct Downloads (Releases)

You can find the `.zip` packages for both versions in the **[Releases](https://github.com/Cruz75/PGA-Tour-2k25-Calculator-PRO/releases)** section of this repository.
